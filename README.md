Western Crossing was part of the Throwback-themed jam. It was inspired by the Game & Watch (by nintendo) handheld electronic games (80's 90's) for the layout and controls, and by 'The Oregon Trail' game (MECC 1974) for the story and gameplay.

In Western Crossing you control an oxen-pulled wagon on your journey to cross a dangerous desert. Stones on the path will break your wheels and snakes will bite and kill your oxen. A wagon with a broken wheel has limited steering. You can shoot the snakes, but do not exhaust all your ammo!

Finally, you may visit tents occasionally appearing on your path to get aid from the local Chief. The Chief will fix your wagon's wheel, if broken, provide one oxen, if you do not already own 4, or give you 5 bullets (in that order).
There is no defined goal, just try to cover as much distance as you can.  


Controls:

`up/down` arrows, or `w/s` to move up and down (also use `up` or `w` to visit the tent when adjacent to it).

`left` arrow or `a` to shoot

`p` to pause

`r` to reset

You can also press the on-screen buttons with the cursor.


Enjoy!
